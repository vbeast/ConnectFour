This is an AI system that can play a game of connect four either against itself or against a human.
To Run the program cd to the directory you download it into and use the command "python ConnectFour [player1 type] [player2 type]".
Player type can be human or ai and any combination of the two are valid inputs. Humans move by entering the column they wish to place a chip into using a zero index from left to right. Left most being zero. Have fun trying to compete.
